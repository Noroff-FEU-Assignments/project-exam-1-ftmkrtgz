            <h3>The importance of reading books in child development</h3>
            <p>
              You don't have to wait for your children to grow up before reading
              story books to them. Research emphasizes the importance of parents
              reading books, especially before bedtime, starting from infancy.
              In this way, your baby is calmed by your voice and he/she learns
              sounds by the age of 1. At the same time, reading books, which is
              a very useful activity, goes well with your voice, which he loves
              and feels close to. Story reading before bed is an activity that
              supports the development of children. I recommend that you make
              reading a storybook while putting your baby to sleep a pre-sleep
              routine, such as taking a bath, starting from about the 6th month.

          <h3>The contribution of reading storybooks to child development</h3>
          <p>
            The habit of reading storybooks acquired at an early age is very
            important for your child's language-cognitive development in later
            ages. In this way, your child learns more words, recognizes more
            sounds, objects and colors. When he turns 1 year old, he will
            recognize and know all the basic sounds he needs to speak. This is
            also important for speaking skills. When he gets a little older and
            begins to understand storybook content, his emotional and social
            intelligence improves. Now he can follow the events while reading a
            book to him, imagine, imitate sounds and characters, and act out. In
            addition, you can have a lot of fun together while reading books and
            contribute to your child's love of books. While reading a story
            book, the relationship you establish with both the characters in the
            book and each other will support your social development and ability
            to communicate correctly. Remember, your child takes you and your
            actions as an example and imitates them. When you read a book, you
            become a good example reader for him.
          </p>
          <h3>Personalized children's books</h3>
          <p>
            While reading storybooks is a very useful activity in itself, if
            these books are specially prepared for your child, much more
            enjoyable reading hours await you. Personalized books are special
            books prepared with your child's name or other characteristics in
            the book. If the story specifically involves your child, your child
            will become more curious while reading these books, will love the
            book and want to read it again and again.

            <p>
              Parents and children not only have a great time while reading a
              book together, but also make a very good investment in the
              development of their language-cognitive skills and supporting
              their imagination.

            <p>
              Magical Journey books are a very good start in order to help
              children acquire the habit of reading books. I recommend these
              books to all families, where children will feel special.

              People have been raising their children with fairy tales for
              thousands of years. The stories we hear in childhood shape our
              worldview and enable us to make sense of many issues, emotions and
              life events about the planet we live in and its dynamics.
            </p>
            <p>
              Books that affect our unconscious and affect us deeply; It helps
              us expand our world, broaden our horizons, develop extraordinary
              skills, and increase our resilience.

            <p>
              In Magic Journey, children embark on a unique adventure with
              stories specially designed for their own names. I have no doubt
              that this unique experience will have a tremendous impact on their
              emotional development and reading habits!
